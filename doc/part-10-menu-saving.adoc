Now that our game is bursting with gameplay potential, we can think
about those little things that die-hard fans will surely miss during
their long playing sessions. One of the most important is, of course,
a save/load mechanism! This way they can go to sleep and dream about
your scary monsters between play sessions.

== The Game struct

Before we get to the meat of this, we'll do something that will make
our lives a bit easier -- we'll put some more items into a common
`struct` that we'll pass around! We've already done that for the
libtcod-related stuff and now let's add the rest!

Create this struct:

[source]
----
struct Game {
    map: Map,
    log: Messages,
    inventory: Vec<Object>,
}
----

So right it'll just hold the map, the message log and the inventory.
We'll add more things later on, but let's start small.

Now let's move our initialisation code under this struct. In `main`:

[source]
----
let mut game = Game {
    // generate map (at this point it's not drawn to the screen)
    map: make_map(&mut objects),
    // create the list of game messages and their colors, starts empty
    log: vec![],
    inventory: vec![],
};
----

You can now remove the individual variables for `map`, `messages` and
`inventory` and try to compile. This will of course show errors where
we refer to the removed variables so let's use those to fix the `main`
function.

Basically, we'll replace all mentions of `map` with `game.map`, `messages`
with `&mut game.log` and so on.

For example the FoV map code now looks like this:

[source]
----
for y in 0..MAP_HEIGHT {
    for x in 0..MAP_WIDTH {
        tcod.fov.set(x, y,
                     !game.map[x as usize][y as usize].block_sight,
                     !game.map[x as usize][y as usize].blocked);
    }
}
----

And the "welcoming" message:

[source]
----
message(&mut game.log, "Welcome stranger! Prepare to perish in the Tombs of the Ancient Kings.",
        colors::RED);
----

There's about 8 more things to fix. After that we should be compiling
again, but it doesn't seem like really helped anything.

So let's update the rest of the code to take advantage of our
newfangled `Game` struct!

For example, let's update our `render_all` call to just pass `Game` once:

[source]
----
render_all(&mut tcod, &objects, &mut game, fov_recompute);
----

And then change the function signature:

[source]
----
fn render_all(tcod: &mut Tcod, objects: &[Object], game: &mut Game, fov_recompute: bool) {
    // ...
}
----

And (you guessed it!) *let the compiler guide you*.

As you'll notice, this will actually requires to change a lot more
than just the `render_all` function. That is because some of the
spells call `target_tile` which has it's own separate game loop. While
that's OK in this tutorial, you can see how coupled it makes the rest
of the code.

Think about ways of solving this with a single game loop running in
`main`, but we won't bother here because it would make the tutorial
even longer.

Since this touches a lot of it'll take a while to fix although the
changes are mostly mechanical -- just pass `&mut Game` to functions
that take e.g. inventory and the message log and fix the same whenever
they're being called.

For example this is what `use_item` looks like now:

[source]
----
fn use_item(inventory_id: usize, objects: &mut [Object], game: &mut Game, tcod: &mut Tcod) {  // <1>
    use Item::*;
    // just call the "use_function" if it is defined
    if let Some(item) = game.inventory[inventory_id].item {  // <2>
        let on_use: fn(usize, &mut [Object], &mut Game, &mut Tcod) -> UseResult = match item {  // <3>
            Heal => cast_heal,
            Lightning => cast_lightning,
            Confuse => cast_confuse,
            Fireball => cast_fireball,
        };
        match on_use(inventory_id, objects, game, tcod) {  // <4>
            UseResult::UsedUp => {
                // destroy after use, unless it was cancelled for some reason
                game.inventory.remove(inventory_id);
            }
            UseResult::Cancelled => {
                message(&mut game.log, "Cancelled", colors::WHITE);  // <5>
            }
        }
    } else {
        message(&mut game.log,
                format!("The {} cannot be used.", game.inventory[inventory_id].name),
                colors::WHITE);
    }
}
----
<1> Replace `inventory` and `messages` with `game`
<2> `inventory` is now `game.inventory`
<3> Replace the inventory and messages types with `&mut Game`
<4> Pass just `game` to on_use
<5> `messages` is now `&mut game.log`

And `handle_keys` calls it like so:

[source]
----
use_item(inventory_index, objects, game, tcod);
----

Once you get things compiling, everything should work again. If you're
struggling, take a look at link:part-10-menu-saving.rs.txt[the
complete code for this section].

After this, you can either stop or keep going as there are a few more
functions that could take `Game` instead: the `ai_take_turn`,
`ak_basic` and `ai_confused` are good examples, but we might as well
go all the way: `take_damage`, `attack`, etc.


And once you've done all that, let's simplify the way we log our
messages. Right now, you have to write:

[source]
----
message(&mut game.log, "You died!", colors::RED);
----

We can simplify that to:

[source]
----
game.log.add("You died!", colors::RED);
----

NOTE: We could just have `game.log("message", colour)` by adding a
`log` method on the `Game` struct, but that would
conflict with Rust's mutability rules. Consider what would happen if
you wanted to e.g. iterate over all items in the inventory and call
`game.log()` while in the loop. We didn't include the `objects` vec
in `Game` for the same reason.

So, to do that, we have two options: either create a new type that
wraps the underlying `Vec<(String, Color)>` and has the `add()` method
(_BORING_) or *we put the method the vec type directly*. I know,
right?

Rust let's you implement traits to types you don't control (e.g.
because they come from the standard library like our `Vec`) assuming
you control the trait.

So we create a `MessageLog` trait with the `add` method:

[source]
----
trait MessageLog {
    fn add<T: Into<String>>(&mut self, message: T, color: Color);
}
----

Traits are like interfaces in Java and other languages: they describe
a group of method signatures that a type implementing the trait needs
to have.

If we implement the trait for a concrete type, it will be able to call
those methods and we can pass it to functions that expect that trait.

So:

[source]
----
impl MessageLog for Vec<(String, Color)> {
    fn add<T: Into<String>>(&mut self, message: T, color: Color) {
        self.push((message.into(), color));
    }
}
----

This is basically the same thing as our `message` function does,
expect it's a method (so it takes an explicit `&mut self`) and we
don't bother with the message count check.

And now, we can just add messages to the log by calling:

[source]
----
game.log.add("some message", color::WHITE);
----

This will mean changing all the message-printing code. You know what's
a great way to do this? Remove the `message` function and _let the
compiler guide you_.


== Tidy initialization

To choose between continuing a previous game or starting a new one we
need a main menu. But wait: our initialization logic and game loop are
tightly bound, so they're not really prepared for these tasks. To
avoid code duplication, we need to break them down into meaningful
blocks (functions). We can then put them together to change between
the menu and the game, start new games or load them, and even go to
new dungeon levels. It's much easier than it sounds, so fear not!

Take a look at your initialization and game loop code, after all the
functions. I can identify 4 blocks:

* *System initialization* (initialising the tcod window and consoles)
* *Setting up a new game* (everything else except for the game loop
   and the FOV map creation)
* *Creating the FOV map*
* *Starting the game loop*

We can use these as the building blocks to make up the higher-level
tasks like loading the game or moving to a new level:

* *Create a new game*: set up the game, create FOV map, start game
   loop (this is what we have now).
* *Load game*: load data (we won't deal with this block just yet),
   create FOV map, start game loop.
* *Advance level*: set up new level (we won't deal with this yet
   either), create FOV map (the game loop is already running and will
   just continue).

Let's put everything from `main` except for the system initialisation
and the main loop into a `new_game` function:

[source]
----
fn new_game(tcod: &mut Tcod) -> (Vec<Object>, Game) {
    // create object representing the player
    let mut player = Object::new(0, 0, '@', "player", colors::WHITE, true);
    player.alive = true;
    player.fighter = Some(Fighter{max_hp: 30, hp: 30, defense: 2, power: 5,
                                  on_death: DeathCallback::Player});

    // the list of objects with just the player
    let mut objects = vec![player];

    let mut game = Game {
        // generate map (at this point it's not drawn to the screen)
        map: make_map(&mut objects),
        // create the list of game messages and their colors, starts empty
        log: vec![],
        inventory: vec![],
    };

    initialise_fov(&game.map, &mut tcod.fov);

    // a warm welcoming message!
    game.log.add("Welcome stranger! Prepare to perish in the Tombs of the Ancient Kings.",
                 colors::RED);

    (objects, game)
}
----

We return use a tuple to return two arguments: the vec of `Objects` and
the `Game` struct.

`new_game` is calling `initialise_fov` so we need create it and move
the FOV-related code to it:

[source]
----
fn initialise_fov(map: &Map, fov_map: &mut FovMap) {
    // create the FOV map, according to the generated map
    for y in 0..MAP_HEIGHT {
        for x in 0..MAP_WIDTH {
            fov_map.set(x, y,
                        !map[x as usize][y as usize].block_sight,
                        !map[x as usize][y as usize].blocked);
        }
    }
}
----

Finally, the game loop and the few bits before it belong to their own
function as well:

[source]
----
fn play_game(objects: &mut Vec<Object>, game: &mut Game, tcod: &mut Tcod) {
    // force FOV "recompute" first time through the game loop
    let mut previous_player_position = (-1, -1);

    let mut key = Default::default();

    while !tcod.root.window_closed() {
        match input::check_for_event(input::MOUSE | input::KEY_PRESS) {
            Some((_, Event::Mouse(m))) => tcod.mouse = m,
            Some((_, Event::Key(k))) => key = k,
            _ => key = Default::default(),
        }

        // render the screen
        let fov_recompute = previous_player_position != (objects[PLAYER].pos());
        render_all(tcod, &objects, game, fov_recompute);

        tcod.root.flush();

        // erase all objects at their old locations, before they move
        for object in objects.iter_mut() {
            object.clear(&mut tcod.con)
        }

        // handle keys and exit game if needed
        previous_player_position = objects[PLAYER].pos();
        let player_action = handle_keys(key, tcod, objects, game);
        if player_action == PlayerAction::Exit {
            break
        }

        // let monstars take their turn
        if objects[PLAYER].alive && player_action != PlayerAction::DidntTakeTurn {
            for id in 0..objects.len() {
                if objects[id].ai.is_some() {
                    ai_take_turn(id, objects, game, &tcod.fov);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

And now we just call `new_game` and `play_game` from our slimmed-down
`main` function:

[source]
----
fn main() {
    let root = Root::initializer()
        .font("arial10x10.png", FontLayout::Tcod)
        .font_type(FontType::Greyscale)
        .size(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT)
        .title("Rust/libtcod tutorial")
        .init();
    tcod::system::set_fps(LIMIT_FPS);

    let mut tcod = Tcod {
        root: root,
        con: Offscreen::new(MAP_WIDTH, MAP_HEIGHT),
        panel: Offscreen::new(SCREEN_WIDTH, PANEL_HEIGHT),
        fov: FovMap::new(MAP_WIDTH, MAP_HEIGHT),
        mouse: Default::default(),
    };

    let (mut objects, mut game) = new_game(&mut tcod);
    play_game(&mut objects, &mut game, &mut tcod);
}
----

`let (a, b) = some_tuple` is how we turn a tuple into its parts. We
have to put `mut` in front of each one so Rust lets us change them
later.

You can think of `let (mut a, mut b)` as two separate bindings: `let
mut a = ...` and `let mut b = ...`. Except since `new_game` returns a
tuple, we can't really have them as separate.


Anyway, the game should compile again and the setup code is more
modular. Which will come in handy in the coming sections.

== The main menu

:image: http://tomassedovic.github.io/tcod-rs/tcod/image/index.html

To keep our main menu from appearing a bit bland, it would be pretty
cool to show a neat background image below it. Fortunately, tcod lets
us {image}[load and display images]!

Since libtcod emulates a console, we can't directly show arbitrary
images, since we can't access the console's pixels. We can, however,
modify the background color of every console cell to match the color
of a pixel from the image. The downside is that the image will be in a
very low resolution.

:subcell: http://roguecentral.org/doryen/data/libtcod/doc/1.5.1/html2/image_blit.html?c=true

However, libtcod can do a neat trick: by using specialized characters,
and modifying both foreground and background colors, we can double the
resolution! This is called subcell resolution, and {subcell}[this page of the
docs] shows some images of the effect (at the end of the page).

:background: https://github.com/tomassedovic/roguelike-tutorial/blob/master/menu_background.png

This means that, for our 80x50 cells console, we need a 160x100 pixels
image. We'll be using the {background}[image from the original Python
tutorial].

[source]
----
fn main_menu(tcod: &mut Tcod) {
    let img = tcod::image::Image::from_file("menu_background.png")  // <1>
        .ok().expect("Background image not found");  // <2>

    while !tcod.root.window_closed() {  // <3>
        // show the background image, at twice the regular console resolution
        tcod::image::blit_2x(&img, (0, 0), (-1, -1), &mut tcod.root, (0, 0));

        // show options and wait for the player's choice
        let choices = &["Play a new game", "Continue last game", "Quit"];
        let choice = menu("", choices, 24, &mut tcod.root);

        match choice {  // <4>
            Some(0) => {  // new game
                let (mut objects, mut game) = new_game(tcod);
                play_game(&mut objects, &mut game, tcod);
            }
            Some(2) => {  // quit
                break;
            }
            _ => {}  // <5>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Load the background image
<2> Exit if the loading failed
<3> Show the main menu in a loop -- this lets us play another game
after the current one ends
<4> Either start a new game or quit
<5> If the player selects anything else, keep showing the menu


Now replace the calls to `new_game` and `play_game` in `main` with:

[source]
----
main_menu(&mut tcod);
----

If you try it out now, you'll see a nice menu with a dungeon-y
backdrop!

Now let's add the game's title and some credits. You'll probably want
to modify the values. Put this in the `main_menu` before calling the
`menu` function:

[source]
----
tcod.root.set_default_foreground(colors::LIGHT_YELLOW);
tcod.root.print_ex(SCREEN_WIDTH/2, SCREEN_HEIGHT/2 - 4,
                   BackgroundFlag::None, TextAlignment::Center,
                   "TOMBS OF THE ANCIENT KINGS");
tcod.root.print_ex(SCREEN_WIDTH/2, SCREEN_HEIGHT - 2,
                   BackgroundFlag::None, TextAlignment::Center,
                   "By Yours Truly");
----

You'll notice that the menu rectangle starts with a blank line. That
is because the header string is empty, but `root.get_height_rect`
reports its height as `1` by default.

To make the line go away, we need to check that condition in the
`menu` function:

[source]
----
// calculate total height for the header (after auto-wrap) and one line per option
let header_height = if header.is_empty() {
    0
} else {
    root.get_height_rect(0, 0, width, SCREEN_HEIGHT, header)
};
----

Finally, when you start a game, go back to the main menu with Escape
and start another game results in a bug! Parts of the first game are
still visible in the second game. To fix that, we need to clear the
console.

In `new_game` before `initialise_fov`:

[source]
----
tcod.con.clear();  // unexplored areas start black (which is the default background color)
----

There it is, a neat main menu, and with only a handful of lines of code!



== Saving and loading

Storing a game state to disk (and then reloading it) is not
conceptually hard: You could imagine just taking all the data from our
`game` and `objects` variables and writing them to a file value by
value.

It would, however, be a huge hassle that would require a ton of code,
you'd need to define a way to structure the data in the file and
there's a good chance you'd get a lot of bugs at first.

Luckily, there are ways of automating most of this that make saving
and loading quite painless. Here's the teaser:

[source]
----
fn save_game(objects: &[Object], game: &Game) -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {  // <1><2>
    let save_data = try! { json::encode(&(objects, game)) };  // <3>
    let mut file = try! { File::create("savegame") };  // <4>
    try!{ file.write_all(save_data.as_bytes()) }  // <5>
    Ok(())  // <6>
}
----
<1> save `objects` and `game` -- they contain all our game state
<2> the saving could fail so return a `Result` which could be `Ok` or `Err`
<3> convert both `objects` and `game` into json
<4> create a file called "savegame" -- that's where we'll write the
game state
<5> write the json-ified game state to the file
<6> if nothing went wrong return `Ok`, indicating success

Quite straightforward, but there's a couple of things we haven't done
before: serialisation and error handling.

Serialisation is a process that converts your data into a sequence of
bytes for sending and decoding somewhere else (or say in a future like
in the save/load game case).
