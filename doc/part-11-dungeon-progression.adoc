<<index#,Back to the index.>>

What we have now is pretty much a playable game already. The next two
parts will take it a big step forward by focusing on progression.
We'll start with dungeon levels, then character progression and
finally on updating the monster and item placement.

== Second floor please

A staple of roguelikes is the stairs, which the player must find to
advance to the next dungeon level. We will start by placing them, when
generating a level. Right at the end of `make_map`:

[source]
----
// create stairs at the center of the last room
let (last_room_x, last_room_y) = rooms[rooms.len() - 1].center();
let stairs = Object::new(last_room_x, last_room_y, '<', "stairs", colors::WHITE, false);
objects.push(stairs);
----

As you can see, it's just a regular object! We must now let the player
go down the stairs when standing on them and presses the '<' key. It's
easy to add this check at the end of `handle_keys`:

[source]
----
(Key { printable: '<', .. }, true) => {
    // go down stairs, if the player is on them
    let player_on_stairs = objects.iter().any(|object| {
        object.pos() == objects[PLAYER].pos() && object.name == "stairs"
    });
    if player_on_stairs {
        next_level(tcod, objects, game);
    }
    DidntTakeTurn
}
----

The most important bit is the `next_level` function. We need to
generate a brand new level when the player goes down and move player
onto it. We'll also heal the player because we're feeling generous!

[source]
----
/// Advance to the next level
fn next_level(tcod: &mut Tcod, objects: &mut Vec<Object>, game: &mut Game) {
    game.log.add("You take a moment to rest, and recover your strength.", colors::VIOLET);
    let heal_hp = objects[PLAYER].fighter.map_or(0, |f| f.max_hp / 2);
    objects[PLAYER].heal(heal_hp);

    game.log.add("After a rare moment of peace, you descend deeper into \
                  the heart of the dungeon...", colors::RED);
    game.map = make_map(objects);
    initialise_fov(&game.map, tcod);
}
----

You can try it out now. We do generate stairs and let the player go
deeper, but you'll notice that the items and monsters from the old
level are still here -- sometimes lodged in a wall.

The reason we're seeing old objects is because we've never removed
them from the `objects` Vec!

So we need to remove everything except for the Player. Put this in
`make_map` right after we create the empty map:

[source]
----
// Player is the first element, remove everything else.
// NOTE: works only when the player is the first object!
assert_eq!(&objects[PLAYER] as *const _, &objects[0] as *const _);
objects.truncate(1);
----

:truncate: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.truncate

Luckily, {truncate}[Vec has the truncate method], which leaves the
first *n* elements and removes everything else. Since our _player_ is
always the first object in the list, this just works.

The assert is there to make sure that the first object is indeed the
player -- the program will panic otherwise, making sure you address it
if you change your game layout at some point. By the way, this is how
you test for a pointer equivalence in Rust: you convert ordinary Rust
references to raw pointers (`*const Object` in this case) and compare
those. This is safe because we never dereference them. As a bonus, the
compiler can infer the type (`Object`) so you can just say `_` and it
will fill it in.

NOTE: If you want to let the player go back up, you may want to keep
track of the map and objects at the previous levels so that they stay
the same.

We'll want to keep track of the dungeon level the player is on. Let's
add a variable to `Game` and set it to one when we start the game and
increase it when we go deeper:

[source]
----
struct Game {
    map: Map,
    log: Messages,
    inventory: Vec<Object>,
    dungeon_level: u32,
}
----

in `new_game`:

[source]
----
let mut game = Game {
    // ...
    dungeon_level: 1,
};
----

and in `next_level` before calling `make_map`:

[source]
----
game.dungeon_level += 1;
----

Now we can display it in the GUI. Add this line to `render_all` after
calling `render_bar`:

[source]
----
tcod.panel.print_ex(1, 3, BackgroundFlag::None, TextAlignment::Left,
                    format!("Dungeon level: {}", game.dungeon_level));
----

Finally, it would be great to always show the stairs once discovered,
so the player can explore the rest of the map before going down. So
let's allow some objects to be always visible as long as they're on a
tile that's already been explored.

We can add `always_visible` to `Object`:

[source]
----
struct Object {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
    // ...
    always_visible: bool,
}
----

Let's initialise it to `false` in `Object::new`:

[source]
----
pub fn new(x: i32, y: i32, char: char, name: &str, color: Color, blocks: bool) -> Self {
    Object {
        x: x,
        y: y,
        // ...
        always_visible: false,
    }
}
----

Now update `render_all` to take it into account. When building the
`to_draw` vector, let's update the `filter` test to this:

[source]
----
.filter(|o| {
    tcod.fov.is_in_fov(o.x, o.y) ||
        (o.always_visible && game.map[o.x as usize][o.y as usize].explored)
}).collect();
----

We keep the old `is_in_fov` test, but now we can also show the object
if it's always visible and on an `explored` tile.

So let's set `always_visible = true` to stairs in `make_map`:

[source]
----
stairs.always_visible = true;
----

you will also have to add `mut` to `let stairs` a line above.

And let's do the same for items, too! In `place_objects` before
`objects.push(item)`.


== Character progression

With being able to go into deeper levels, the player character now
feels a bit static. Let's track their experience and allow to
level up. We'll put a new `xp` field into the `Fighter` struct:

[source]
----
struct Fighter {
    // ...
    xp: i32,
}
----

When setting the orc and trolls' `Fighter` component in
`place_objects`, we'll add 35 and 100 `xp` respectively. Feel free to
plug your own values here.

We'll have to set player's XP in `new_game` to something as well.
Let's put a `0` in and we'll use it to track player's experience.


Now update `take_damage` to return the experience points when a
monster is killed:

[source]
----
pub fn take_damage(&mut self, damage: i32, game: &mut Game) -> Option<i32> {  // <1>
    // apply damage if possible
    if let Some(fighter) = self.fighter.as_mut() {
        if damage > 0 {
            fighter.hp -= damage;
        }
    }
    // check for death, call the death function
    if let Some(fighter) = self.fighter {
        if fighter.hp <= 0 {
            self.alive = false;
            fighter.on_death.callback(self, game);
            return Some(fighter.xp);  // <2>
        }
    }
    None  // <3>
}
----
<1> May return a number of XP if `take_damage` killed the monster
<2> We did kill the monster, return its XP
<3> We did not kill the monster, don't return anything


Now in `attack`, when an attacker kills its target, let's increase its
xp by replacing the `target.take_damage(...)` call with:

[source]
----
if let Some(xp) = target.take_damage(damage, game) {
    // yield experience to the player
    self.fighter.as_mut().unwrap().xp += xp;
}
----

And we need to do the same in the two other places we're calling
`take_damage`. First in `cast_lightning`:

[source]
----
if let Some(xp) = objects[monster_id].take_damage(LIGHTNING_DAMAGE, game) {
    objects[PLAYER].fighter.as_mut().unwrap().xp += xp;
}
----

The `cast_fireball` function is going to be slightly trickier because
we don't want to give the player XP for burning themself and we can't
modify the player inside the loop because the `objects` Vec is already
mutably borrowed.

So, whenever we get some XP from `take_damage`, we'll add it to a
variable and then give it all to the player afterwards:

[source]
----
let mut xp_to_gain = 0;  // <1>
for (id, obj) in objects.iter_mut().enumerate() {  // <2>
    if obj.distance(x, y) <= FIREBALL_RADIUS as f32 && obj.fighter.is_some() {
        game.log.add(format!("The {} gets burned for {} hit points.", obj.name, FIREBALL_DAMAGE),
                     colors::ORANGE);
        if let Some(xp) = obj.take_damage(FIREBALL_DAMAGE, game) {
            // Don't reward the player for burning themself!
            if id != PLAYER {  // <3>
                xp_to_gain += xp;
            }
        }
    }
}
objects[PLAYER].fighter.as_mut().unwrap().xp += xp_to_gain;  // <4>
----
<1> Keep track of all the XP player should receive
<2> Use `enumerate` to get the object's index as well
<3> Use the index to make sure we don't include the player's XP
<4> Give all the accumulated XP to the player


Ok, so what can the player do with all this experience they're getting
now? Level up of course!

First, we'll need to keep track of player's level. We'll add it as
another field to `Object` (so that monsters and items can have levels
too if we decide to use them later), but you could add it into `Game`
just as easily.

[source]
----
struct Object {
    // ...
    level: i32,
}
----

And initialise it to `1` in Object's `new` method:

[source]
----
    pub fn new(x: i32, y: i32, char: char, name: &str, color: Color, blocks: bool) -> Self {
        Object {
            // ...
            level: 1,
        }
    }
----

Typically, you need more experience to level up the higher you get.
Let's set the starting point to 350 xp and then require 150 for every
new level. So the formula is `200 + player.level * 150`.

Add constants so it can be easily tweaked later:

[source]
----
// experience and level-ups
const LEVEL_UP_BASE: i32 = 200;
const LEVEL_UP_FACTOR: i32 = 150;
----

Now the function that level's the player up if they have enough
experience:

[source]
----
fn level_up(objects: &mut [Object], game: &mut Game, tcod: &mut Tcod) {
    let player = &mut objects[PLAYER];
    let level_up_xp = LEVEL_UP_BASE + player.level * LEVEL_UP_FACTOR;
    // see if the player's experience is enough to level-up
    if player.fighter.as_ref().map_or(0, |f| f.xp) >= level_up_xp {
        // it is! level up
        player.level += 1;
        game.log.add(format!("Your battle skills grow stronger! You reached level {}!",
                             player.level),
                     colors::YELLOW);
        // ... TODO increase players's stats!
    }
}
----

So, if the player has enough experience, we'll increase their level
and print out a message.

But let's give them an actual gameplay bonus. Using the `menu`
function, we'll give them three choices: to increase the HP, attack or
defense.

Put this in place of the TODO comment:

[source]
----
let fighter = player.fighter.as_mut().unwrap();
let mut choice = None;
while choice.is_none() {  // keep asking until a choice is made
    choice = menu(
        "Level up! Choose a stat to raise:\n",
        &[format!("Constitution (+20 HP, from {})", fighter.max_hp),
          format!("Strength (+1 attack, from {})", fighter.power),
          format!("Agility (+1 defense, from {})", fighter.defense)],
        LEVEL_SCREEN_WIDTH, &mut tcod.root);
};
fighter.xp -= level_up_xp;
match choice.unwrap() {
    0 => {
        fighter.max_hp += 20;
        fighter.hp += 20;
    }
    1 => {
        fighter.power += 1;
    }
    2 => {
        fighter.defense += 1;
    }
    _ => unreachable!(),
}
----

We'll need to set `const LEVEL_SCREEN_WIDTH: i32 = 40` on top of the
file and then it should compile.

Now we can call `level_up` in the main loop (in `play_game`) after
`tcod.root.flush()`:

[source]
----
// level up if needed
level_up(objects, game, tcod);
----

So the player can now level up, but it would be great to show the
current stats somewhere. Let's display a little message box when the
`C` key is pressed. In `handle_keys`:

[source]
----
(Key { printable: 'c', .. }, true) => {
    // show character information
    let player = &objects[PLAYER];
    let level = player.level;
    let level_up_xp = LEVEL_UP_BASE + player.level * LEVEL_UP_FACTOR;
    if let Some(fighter) = player.fighter.as_ref() {
        let msg = format!("Character information

Level: {}
Experience: {}
Experience to level up: {}

Maximum HP: {}
Attack: {}
Defense: {}", level, fighter.xp, level_up_xp, fighter.max_hp, fighter.power, fighter.defense);
        msgbox(&msg, CHARACTER_SCREEN_WIDTH, &mut tcod.root);
    }

    DidntTakeTurn
}
----

This will build up a multiline string that we use msgbox to show.
We'll need to define `const CHARACTER_SCREEN_WIDTH: i32 = 30;` at the
top of the file and then it should all work.

It would also be nice if we showed how much XP did the player get for
slaying a monster. We can modify the log message in `monster_death`:

[source]
----
game.log.add(
    format!("{} is dead! You gain {} experience points.",
            monster.name, monster.fighter.unwrap().xp), colors::ORANGE);
----


/
Finally, completely unrelated to the character progression, but let's
add diagonal movement and sleep command using the keys on the numpad.

The key codes for the numpad keys are `NumPad0` to `NumPad9`. So in
`handle_keys`, we'll replace the existing movement code with this:

[source]
----
// movement keys
(Key { code: Up, .. }, true) | (Key { code: NumPad8, ..}, true) => {
    player_move_or_attack(0, -1, objects, game);
    TookTurn
}
(Key { code: Down, .. }, true) | (Key { code: NumPad2, ..}, true) => {
    player_move_or_attack(0, 1, objects, game);
    TookTurn
}
(Key { code: Left, .. }, true) | (Key { code: NumPad4, ..}, true) => {
    player_move_or_attack(-1, 0, objects, game);
    TookTurn
}
(Key { code: Right, .. }, true) | (Key { code: NumPad6, ..}, true) => {
    player_move_or_attack(1, 0, objects, game);
    TookTurn
}
(Key { code: Home, .. }, true) | (Key { code: NumPad7, ..}, true) => {
    player_move_or_attack(-1, -1, objects, game);
    TookTurn
}
(Key { code: PageUp, .. }, true) | (Key { code: NumPad9, ..}, true) => {
    player_move_or_attack(1, -1, objects, game);
    TookTurn
}
(Key { code: End, .. }, true) | (Key { code: NumPad1, ..}, true) => {
    player_move_or_attack(-1, 1, objects, game);
    TookTurn
}
(Key { code: PageDown, .. }, true) | (Key { code: NumPad3, ..}, true) => {
    player_move_or_attack(1, 1, objects, game);
    TookTurn
}
(Key { code: NumPad5, .. }, true) => {
    TookTurn  // do nothing, i.e. wait for the monster to come to you
}
----

Now we can use arrows and numpad to move around. And pressing `5` will
let you skip a turn and have the monster come to you.

Here's link:part-11-dungeon-progression.rs.txt[the complete code so far].
